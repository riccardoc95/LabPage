    "title": "Topological Data Analysis of Images via Persistent Homology",
    "summary": "This research area focuses on the development and application of topological data analysis (TDA) techniques, specifically persistent homology, for the study of 2D images. By leveraging topological invariants, the goal is to extract robust and scale-invariant features that capture the underlying structure of image data. The approach enables a deeper understanding of shape, connectivity, and texture beyond traditional pixel-based methods.",
